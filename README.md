# download-single-use-files

When this python script is running, everytime the user downloads a file to the "Downloads" directory, it will ask through a pop-up window if they want to make this download a single use file. A single use file would be a file that is opened right after the download and deleted after that. So once closed the file will never be accessible again. The point of this is to not keep on our hard drive all the files that we download to just have a quick look at them. Your "Downloads" directory will forever be "clean".
